## Story Overview

You're a detective in hot water. After pushing a witness too hard, they lawyered up and your last case went cold. The Lieutenant isn't happy and neither is the rest of the department.

Your punishment? Babysitting rookie Detective Hayes on a "simple" neighborhood robbery:
- **The Crime:** Jim's wallet was stolen, $20 missing. Neighbor John claims he was also robbed but never reported it.
- **The Twist:** Someone's lying, and if you screw this up, you might be the one in cuffs.
- **The Stakes:** Prove you can be trusted around people again or lose your badge.

But this isn't just about solving a case. Lucas needs dating advice. Tim's causing drama. And Marcus is watching every move you make.

**Can you solve the case without burning another lead?**

## Technical Architecture


**Rendering Pipeline**
- **Offscreen canvas buffering** — Pre-renders entire map to buffer, then draws viewport slice each frame
- **Camera system** — Smooth tracking with configurable bounds, supports viewport scaling for mobile
- **Layered rendering** — Base tiles → NPCs → waypoint markers → player sprite → UI overlay
- **Sprite animation** — Frame based animation system with configurable timing (idle: 600ms, walk: 150ms)
```javascript
// Viewport culling optimization
const visibleTiles = {
  startX: Math.max(0, camera.x),
  startY: Math.max(0, camera.y),
  endX: Math.min(mapWidth, camera.x + viewCols),
  endY: Math.min(mapHeight, camera.y + viewRows)
};
// Only render what's on screen
```

**Collision & Movement**
- **Grid-based collision detection** — Parses Tiled collision layers, builds collision map
- **Movement cooldown system** — Prevents rapid inputs (110ms debounce)
- **Smooth camera lerping** — Player stays centered, camera interpolates to new position
- **Mobile touch controls** — Custom D-pad with pointer events + haptic feedback

**Map Loading & Transitions**
- **Tiled TMJ parser** — Reads layered maps, tileset metadata, object layers (NPCs, triggers)
- **GID decoding** — Handles flipped tiles, tileset indexing, multi-tileset support
- **Async asset loading** — Preloads tilesets + NPC spritesheets before map render

### Dialogue Engine
State-driven conversation system with complex conditional logic:

**Core Architecture**
```javascript
// Node structure
{
  segments: [
    { 
      speaker: "npc", 
      text: "Dialogue here", 
      voice: "audio_file",
      requires: { flagsAll: ["flag1"], notClues: ["clue2"] } // Conditional rendering
    }
  ],
  choices: [
    { 
      label: "Response", 
      next: "node_id",
      set: { flagsAdd: ["new_flag"], cluesAdd: ["evidence"] }
    }
  ],
  onEnter: (gameState) => { /* Dynamic scoring logic */ }
}
```
### Quest/Objective System
Dynamic waypoint tracking tied to story state with conditional appearance logic:

**Objective Configuration**
```javascript
// Objectives defined declaratively with appearance/completion conditions
const OBJECTIVES_CONFIG = {
  talk_to_jim: {
    id: 'talk_to_jim',
    title: 'Talk to Jim and Donna',
    description: 'Interview the couple about the missing twenty dollars',
    appearsWhen: { flagsAll: ["debriefed"] },        // Only appears after briefing
    completesWhen: { flagsAny: ['talkedToJim', 'talkedToDonna'] }, // Complete when either flag set
    waypoints: [
      { type: "npc", id: "jim" },
      { type: "npc", id: "donna", hideWhenFlag: "talkedToDonna" } // Waypoint disappears when complete
    ]
  },
  help_bobby: {
    id: 'help_bobby',
    title: '(OPTIONAL) Help Bobby with his investigation',
    optional: true,                                    // Optional objectives styled differently
    appearsWhen: { flagsAll: ['bobby_investigation_bar'] },
    completesWhen: { flagsAny: ['met_bobby_in_bar'] },
    waypoint: { type: "npc", id: "bobby" }
  }
};
```

**Conditional Logic Engine**
- **Appearance conditions** — `flagsAll`, `flagsAny`, `cluesAll`, `metadataAll` (all must match)
- **Completion conditions** — Same logic, but for marking objectives done
- **Hide conditions** — Individual waypoints can disappear mid-objective (e.g., "talk to 3 witnesses" removes markers as you complete each)
- **Required vs Optional** — Optional objectives styled with amber accent

**UI/UX Features**
- **Floating FAB button** — Shows active objective count
- **Bottom sheet (mobile) / Side panel (desktop)** — Responsive design pattern
- **Collapsible completed section** — Keeps focus on active tasks
- **Auto-sorting** — Required objectives always listed first, optional below
- **Live updates** — React useEffect watches `gameState` and `refreshToken` for instant sync

**Waypoint Rendering Integration**
```javascript
// Renders markers on canvas for active objectives
for (const objective of activeObjectives) {
  const waypoints = objective.waypoints || [objective.waypoint];
  
  for (const wp of waypoints) {
    // Skip if waypoint has hideWhenFlag and flag is set
    if (wp.hideWhenFlag && gameState.flags.has(wp.hideWhenFlag)) continue;
    
    const npc = npcs.find(n => n.id === wp.id);
    if (npc) {
      const screenX = (npc.x - camera.x) * tileWidth;
      const screenY = (npc.y - camera.y) * tileHeight;
      drawWaypointMarker(ctx, screenX, screenY, objective.optional);
    }
  }
}
```

### Audio System
Howler.js-based dual-track manager handling BGM and voice independently:

**BGM Manager**
- Crossfades between tracks with configurable fade duration (default 600ms) — old track fades out while new track fades in simultaneously
- Dynamic track selection based on story state — e.g. neighborhood BGM switches to a second track after a key story flag is set, evaluated at map load time
- Pending stop system — prevents race conditions when tracks are swapped rapidly during cutscene transitions

**Voice Manager**
- Voice lines cached per `characterId:clipId` key — repeated lines reuse the same `Howl` instance without reloading
- Auto-duck system — BGM volume lowers when a voice line plays, restores after a configurable hold duration (default 180ms) with smooth fade back up
- Duration tracking — voice durations cached after first load for auto-progression timing without re-reading audio metadata


### WebSocket Multiplayer (Arcade Mode)
Real-time game rooms with state synchronization:

**Server Architecture**
```javascript
// Room-based game state
class Room {
  constructor(id) {
    this.id = id;
    this.players = new Map();
    this.host = null;
    this.game = null; // Pluggable game instance
    this.phase = "lobby"; // lobby | playing | ended
  }
}

// Event handling
socket.on("action", (data, ack) => {
  const room = rooms.get(socket.roomId);
  const result = room.game.reducer(room.game.state, data);
  
  if (result.error) return ack.err(result.error);
  
  room.game.state = result.state;
  io.to(room.id).emit("state", room.serialize());
  ack.ok();
});
```

**Game Plugin System**
- Each game (Connect4, Battleship, etc.) exports: `initialState`, `reducer`, `serialize`
- Server agnostic to game rules — just pipes actions through reducers
- Client handles rendering, server handles validation + broadcast

**Error Handling**
- Rate limiting (5 actions/sec per player)
- Input validation (schema checking on actions)
- Graceful disconnects (host migration, spectator conversion)
- Typed error codes (`RATE_LIMIT`, `NOT_HOST`, `INVALID_MOVE`)

---

## Code Quality & Patterns

### State Management
```javascript
// Centralized game state (no external library)
const GAME = {
  flags: new Set(),           // Story progression
  clues: new Set(),           // Evidence tracking
  metadata: new Map(),        // Scored values
  currentMap: "city",
  playerPosition: { x: 3, y: 3 }
};

// Pure functions for state updates
const hasFlag = (f) => GAME.flags.has(f);
const addClue = (c) => GAME.clues.add(c);
```
